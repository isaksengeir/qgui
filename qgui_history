16.12.15 v2.03
    Fixed Topology prepare 'toggle charge' function bug that prevented 
    removal of atoms as (user) defined in the '[toggle_residues]' in .lib.
    Qoplsaa.lib and Qopls_2015.lib updated with some bug corrections.

23.11.15 v2.02
    Fixed weird problem with converting string to integer in edit_evb.py.

20.11.15 v2.02
    Fixed error caused when no toggle_residue defined in lib.


15.11.15 v2.01b 
    Bug fixes and minor improvements to the Topology prepare tool.
    Removed 'return' statement that hindered the topology input files
    to be written.

06.11.15 v2.0b
    Complete remake of the topology prepare tool. This is now independent of
    forcefield type, and residues that are togglable are defined directly in
    the library file. Topology prepare now also syncs with PyMOL.

18.09.15 v1.2.0
    Added the long time missing option to load a old FEP file
    in the EVB setup. So now you do not have to redefine everything
    when using the same topology.

03.08.15 v1.1.4
    Improved bugs with the Analyze energies tool.

20.01.15 v1.1.3b
    Fixed Qfep input generation in Analyze FEP so that ene files
    are written from lambda = 1 to lambda = 0
    Qfep is also set to run even if qfep.out already exists (this
    is different from EVB).

14.01.15 v1.1.3
    Fixed FEP softcore number syncing error
    When using softcore, all Q atoms have to be defined. Automated.

07.01.15 version 1.1.2
    Fixed 'Recompute EVB' error in Analyze EVB Thermodynamic Parameters

02.01.15 version 1.1.1
    Improved x-labeling for plot in Analyze EVB Thermodynamic Parameters 

25.12.14 version 1.1.0
    Brand new tool available in the Analyze EVB Reaction Energies
    - Fit Marcus parabolas to the diabatic free energy functions
    - Compute the (intrinsic) reorganization energies
    - Visualize the diabatic state functions and the adiabatic
      mixing with and without the eigenvector coeffecients 

22.12.14 version 1.0.7b
    Fixed normalization bug of EVB reaction free energy profiles
    when recomputing EVB in Analyze EVB Reaction Energies.

18.12.14 version 1.0.7
    Launching Qgui with -p automatically sets the workdir to the
    current directory.
    Minor bug fixes to FEP parameter assignment routine.

16.12.14 version 1.0.6
    Fixed handling of non-standard pdb atom names when communicating
    with pymol in Qpymol and FEP setup

14.12.14 version 1.0.5b
    Improved auto-generation of pymol template structures used for
    ffld_server in FEP setup

09.12.14 version 1.0.5
    Added state dependent el_scale for EVB setup.
    Major improvement to autoassignment of parameters in FEP setup

13.10.14 version 1.0.4
    User dependent settings are now stored independent of Qgui code
    in $USER home directory (.qgui)

09.04.14 version 1.0.2b
    New standar error estimation implemented for Analyze LIE.
    (statistical inefficiency. s = lim [tb<E>b/<E>]

07.04.14 version 1.0.1b
   +Changed fine tune search funciton in EVB RRC to
   check [dG(act) - dG(rxn)] when tuning Hij. Old version
   checked only dG(rxn) when fine tuning Hij.
